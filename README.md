## Projects
### Design and Implementation of an IoT Health Monitoring Device.
- The project's goal is to design and implement a three-stage power supply system for a Wearable IoT (WIoT) device intended for health monitoring on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB).
- Software's Used: KiCad, Arduino.
  
### Remote Health Monitoring System
- The project leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide real-time health data monitoring, enabling remote healthcare services. The system integrates multiple sensors, including a Pulse Sensor for heart rate monitoring, a Temperature Sensor for body temperature tracking, and a GPS Module for location tracking.
- Software's used: Arduino IDE.
  
### Radio Frequecncy Carrier Combiner.
- The research was based simulating and fabricating an Radio Frequency Carrier Combiner resonating at Ku band.
- Software's used: CST Studio
  
  ### STM32 Vehicle Controller
- This project involves programing a motorized vehicle using the STM32 microcontroller. The vehicle is programmed to move in a desired path, and IR sensors are used to control its direction and movement along the path. 
- Software's used: STM32 IDE
